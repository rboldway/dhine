We've set up the basics of webpack-rails for you, but you'll still
need to:

  1. Add the 'application' entry point in to your layout, and
  2. Run 'foreman start' to run the webpack-dev-server and rails server

See the README.md for this gem at
https://github.com/mipearson/webpack-rails/blob/master/README.md
for more info.

Thanks for using webpack-rails!
